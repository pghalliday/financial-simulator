## Questions

* Our BV is taxed under Box 2 for our individual tax
  * We pay tax on dividends
  * We pay tax on capital gains from the sale of shares
    * Does this apply if we dissolve the BV, in which case how would we calculate the capital gain?
  * I think this means that the value of the company does not count for box 3
    * Is this correct?
* What is the tax impact of moving assets into the company?
  * Do we issue more shares?
* What is the tax impact of moving assets out of the company?
  * Are we selling shares?
    * How would we calculate the capital gain?
  * Do we make a dividend?
    * The tax rate seems to be the same as on a capital gain
      * so surely it would make sense to sell the shares to the company instead?
