# ## ContinuousRate

# This calculator applies a continuously compounding algorithm, which most accurately reflects a
# continuous return given a desired annual rate.

# %% [markdown]
# Each call to calculate will return the daily amount associated with the given annual rate.

# ## PeriodicRate
#
# This calculator applies a periodic compounding algorithm by applying the same rate to the
# balance for each day without taking into account the unrealized accrued amount. For a constant
# balance, this should provide the same return as the `ContinuousRate`. However,
# for a falling balance it will return less and for a rising balance it will return more.

# %% [markdown]
# Each call to calculate will return the daily amount associated with the given annual rate.

# %%

# > **_NB._** We can see an error here as the total is slightly less than the expected 10,150.
# > This is due to an inadequacy in the algorithm. The rate calculation assumes that
# > quarters are of equal length. This is not the case and can't really be the case, as years
# > cannot be divided into a four equal number of days. We are actually using 3 calendar months
# > per quarter.
# >
# > So why is the result slightly less? This is due to compounding as payments from earlier quarters
# > compound more than those from later quarters. There are fewer days in the first
# > two quarters than the second two, but the daily rate is the same. This means that fewer days
# > of payments are compounded from the first half of the year than if the periods were equal
# > length. The fact that those days compound for more time, as the payment is earlier, does not

# > So why is it here? Well, when investigating how banks calculate interest. It was found that
# > this is how they say they do it. For instance: https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/savings/interest-rates/when-and-how-often-do-you-receive-interest.html
# >
# > However, this did not give any indication of how they compensate for unequal quarters or
# > leap years. As such, the implementation here is probably wrong anyway, so just don't use it!
